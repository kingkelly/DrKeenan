Dear valued patients, <br><br>
As you are likely aware by now, the current Prince Edward Medical Clinic will be permanently closing effective April 1, 2024.<br><br>
This clinic decision was made the same day that I went on maternity leave in late December 2023. Given this most unfortunate timing, despite my best efforts, relocating my practice while on maternity leave was simply not logistically possible.  
My fantastic locum physician, Dr. Bellicoso will continue to look after my patients until March 31, 2024.<br><br>
I am optimistic about opening a new medical practice in early 2025 once I return from maternity leave, at a new location in Etobicoke. 
For those of you who wish to receive updates regarding my future practice plans, I have created an e-mailing list. Please take a moment to sign up to receive updates using the button below.

Thank you once again for allowing me to be a part of your healthcare journey. Whether you have been with me since I opened my office in 2017, or joined my practice more recently, I have truly enjoyed the privilege of getting to know you. I will remember all of you with fond memories. <br><br>
I extend my best wishes to you for success, good health, and happiness and I hope that our paths may cross again in the future.<br><br>
Warm regards,

<div class="subtitle">Continuity of Care </div>

I recognize that changing physicians may be stressful and challenging.  Please see the “Frequently Asked Questions” sheet with tips on finding a new family physician. Given the closure of Prince Edward Medical, there will not be any opportunity for my colleagues to take over the care of my patients. The other physicians will notify their patients as soon as their plans are finalized. <br><br>
<div class="subtitle">Your Medical Records</div>
I have made arrangements with Records Management Ltd for the storage and management of my patient charts.They will provide you or your new family physician with an electronic or paper copy of your file, upon request. Please contact Records Management Ltd directly by phone at 1-800-775-0093, or find them online at <a href="http://www.recordsregistry.ca" target="_blank">recordsregistry.ca</a>.
Finally, please see the "Frequently Asked Questions" sheet for additional logistical details.<br><br>
