			The Future
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			This decision was made the same week that I went on maternity leave in late December 2023. Given this unfortunate timing, I do not have the opportunity to relocate to a new office, and must close my practice. 
My locum physician, Dr. Bellicoso will continue to look after my patients until March 31, 2024.<br><BR>

I am optimistic about opening a new medical practice in 2025 once I return from maternity leave, at a new location in Etobicoke. 

<br><br>
For those of you who wish to receive updates regarding my future practice plans, please take a moment to sign up to my emailing list using the form below.
